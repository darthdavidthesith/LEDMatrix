"""
Explain an empty screen: a wrong team code, or a season that has not started.

Favourite teams are matched by exact ESPN abbreviation, so a plausible-looking
code silently matches nothing and the plugin shows an empty screen with no hint
that the code is at fault. The codes are not always guessable — ESPN calls
Alabama ``ALA`` rather than ``BAMA``, and Golden State ``GS`` rather than
``GSW``. Between seasons a perfectly correct code produces the same empty
screen for a completely different reason, and the two were indistinguishable
from the logs.

This module is diagnostics only. It runs on a daemon thread, once per league per
process, and every failure is swallowed: it must never delay a frame or change
what is displayed.
