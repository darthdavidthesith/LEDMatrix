"""Timezone resolution for the football scoreboard plugin.

Game start times arrive from ESPN/MLB in UTC and have to be converted to the
user's local zone before they are drawn. This module owns the "which zone?"
decision so the switch-mode scorebug (``sports.py``), the scroll-mode game card
(``game_renderer.py``) and the plugin manager all agree.

Resolution order, first valid wins:

1. ``timezone`` in the plugin's own config (explicit per-plugin override)
2. The LEDMatrix global timezone via ``plugin_manager.config_manager``
3. The LEDMatrix global timezone via ``cache_manager.config_manager``
4. The host system's zone (``TZ``, ``/etc/timezone``, ``/etc/localtime``)
5. UTC

Steps 2 and 3 matter because the core does not consistently hang
``config_manager`` off both objects -- reading only one of them is what made
this plugin fall through to UTC while the clock plugin (which checks
``plugin_manager`` first) showed the right time on the same device. Step 4 is
the backstop for cores that expose no ``config_manager`` at all: a Pi with its
system clock set correctly should never end up rendering UTC.

Two traps this module exists to avoid, both of which render every start time
in UTC on a correctly-configured device:

* **The stale ``"UTC"`` artifact.** Before 2.9.0 the plugin wrote
  ``"timezone": "UTC"`` into the *saved* config whenever resolution failed, and
  that write-back stuck -- thereafter shadowing the real global timezone. Step 1
  therefore treats a bare ``"UTC"`` as suspect: it is honored only when nothing
  downstream disagrees. ``Etc/UTC`` is the unambiguous spelling for "I really
  do want UTC"; the bug never produced it, so it is always honored.
* **``get_timezone()``'s own default.** The core's
  ``ConfigManager.get_timezone()`` is ``self.config.get('timezone', 'UTC')``, so
  it hands back ``"UTC"`` for a config that simply has no ``timezone`` key.
  Steps 2 and 3 read the raw config dict instead, so an absent key falls
  through to the system zone rather than latching onto that default.

Module name is plugin-prefixed on purpose -- several plugins ship identically
named top-level modules and the core loads them as bare names (see
``scripts/check_module_collisions.py``).
