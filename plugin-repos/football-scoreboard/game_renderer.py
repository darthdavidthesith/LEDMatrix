Game Renderer for Football Scoreboard Plugin

Extracts game rendering logic into a reusable component that can be used by both
switch mode (one game at a time) and scroll mode (all games scrolling horizontally).

This module provides:
- GameRenderer class for rendering individual game cards as PIL Images
- Pre-loading of team logos for performance
- Support for live, recent, and upcoming game layouts
- Consistent rendering across all display modes

        that. The sizes it produced (6px, then 10px) are both off the 4x6
        face's 7px grid, so the glyphs were anti-aliased -- on an LED matrix
        that is a dim lamp, not a soft edge, and it is why the odds looked
        broken rather than small. And the larger size did not fit: the
        over/under is budgeted against the centre text, and at 10px it lost
        that contest and was dropped entirely, so growing the font cost half
        the odds.

        One crisp grid step reads clearly at every height and leaves room for
        both numbers. Kept as a method rather than a constant because a user
        who sets a size explicitly still overrides it.

        Superseded reasoning, for the record:

        The odds are drawn in the detail font, pinned at 6px because that is
        what suited a 32-tall panel. On a 64-tall one everything around them
        doubled -- logos, card, score -- and the odds stayed 6px, which is why
        they read as an afterthought squeezed into the corners rather than
        part of the card.

        Scaled by height and capped, so a 32-tall panel keeps exactly the 6px
        it always had and only taller panels move. A user-configured size is
        untouched; this only moves the default.

        The cap is 1.75x rather than the 2x the height ratio would give. At 2x
        (12px on a 64-tall panel) the over/under no longer fits beside the
        centre text and the collision guard drops it altogether -- the odds
        would get bigger by losing half of themselves. 1.75x (10px) was the
        largest size measured to still render both over/under and spread.
