"""
Scroll Display Handler for Football Scoreboard Plugin.

Orchestration (scroll-helper configuration, frame pumping, completion,
settings resolution, `global_config['target_fps']`) comes from the core's
`src.common.sports_scroll`, shipped in LEDMatrix 3.2.0. Only the *content*
half lives here: building this sport's game cards and separator icons.

The import below is deliberately unguarded, and the manifest floors at 3.2.0
to match. B5 shipped it wrapped in a try/except with a bundled
`scroll_display_legacy` behind it, so the plugin kept working on an older
core; B6 removed that copy. Keeping the guard with nothing to fall back to
would be worse than not having it -- the failure would name the missing
`scroll_display_legacy` instead of the core module that is actually absent,
which is the one line the user gets before the scoreboard silently stops
appearing.

        """Card width that fits two full-height logos and the score.

        GameRenderer gives each logo (width - centre gap) / 2. With a flat
        128px card and a gap that ignored the score, a 64-tall card had a
        36px gap holding an ~80px score, so the score ran ~17px onto each
        logo. Widening the gap alone would have fixed the overlap by
        shrinking the logos to 22px -- the failure mode of "the logos
        aren't visible" that we already rejected once.

        Sizing the card as "two full-height logos plus the measured gap"
        makes the height the binding constraint instead, so the logos come
        out at their full height AND the score has its own clear strip.

        The gap is measured with a throwaway renderer because the score's
        font comes from config and the element-style resolver, not from
        the card size -- it is the same for a 128px card as for a 256px
        one, so there is no circularity in asking for it first.

        A 32-tall panel computes 2*32 + ~48 = 112 and keeps the 128 it has
        always had; only the tall cards move.

        ADAPTIVE layout needs more. There the logos are already capped at
        the card height once the card reaches 2 x height, so every further
        pixel of width goes entirely into the middle -- the logos do not
        shrink at all. The score is fitted to that middle from a ladder of
        crisp sizes (8, 16, 24, 32), so the gap decides which rung it
        gets, and 48px of gap only fits the 8px rung: the same size
        classic uses, which reads thin on a 64-tall card. Sizing the gap
        for the 16px rung doubles the score and costs nothing in logo
        size. 24px was deliberately not chosen -- it needs a 128px gap,
        so a 256px card, and the extra width lands as dead space either
        side of the score rather than as anything legible.
