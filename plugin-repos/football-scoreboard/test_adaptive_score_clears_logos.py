"""In adaptive layout the score must not be drawn across the team logos.

This is a SEPARATE defect from the classic-path one in
test_vegas_score_clears_the_logos.py, and it is the one that was actually
visible on the 512x64 rig, because that rig sets layout_mode=adaptive.

_render_game_card_adaptive() does not use _center_gap_width() or
_logo_slot_width() at all -- it takes its geometry from the CORE's
src.adaptive_layout.scoreboard_regions(), which deliberately overlaps
score_area with BOTH logo slots by half the logo's width:

    128x64: away[0,44]  score[22,106]  home[84,128]  -> 22px each side
    176x64: away[0,64]  score[32,144]  home[112,176] -> 32px each side

The score is then fitted to that region, so it grows until it spans the logos
and is drawn on top of them. Widening the card does not help: the regions
scale proportionally and the overlap stays at half the logo. So the fix is to
clamp the region to the strip between the slots before fitting.
