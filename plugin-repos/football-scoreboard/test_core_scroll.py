"""After the sunset, the core import is the only implementation there is.

B5 shipped a guarded import: prefer `src.common.sports_scroll`, fall back to a
bundled `scroll_display_legacy.py`. B6 deleted that copy, so the guard went
with it -- wrapping an import that has nothing to fall back to would only
mislabel the failure.

This file used to prove the fallback worked. It now proves the fallback is gone
and cannot come back by accident, which is a narrower claim:

  * the core import is a plain top-level statement, not a guarded one
  * `scroll_display_legacy.py` is not in the plugin and is not imported
  * ScrollDisplay really is built on the core class, checked by identity
  * the manifest floors at or above the release that ships the module
  * on a core without the module, the import fails naming that exact module

The last one is the whole user-visible contract of the sunset.
`PluginManager.load_plugin` catches the ModuleNotFoundError and parks the
plugin in ERROR with a single log line, so the module name in that line is all
the user gets. If the guard ever came back and swallowed the error,
ScrollDisplay would simply be unbound and the symptom would surface much later
as a NameError from the display path.

The manifest check is here because nothing else in either repo asserts the
floor's VALUE. The safety harness runs against core main, which has the module
whatever the manifest says; the plugins repo's manifest gate checks the field's
spelling, not its number; and the registry carries no floor at all. Without
this, a plugin could sunset with a 2.0.0 floor and every gate would stay green
while the store handed it to a 3.1.0 core.
