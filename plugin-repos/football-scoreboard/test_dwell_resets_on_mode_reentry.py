"""
Tests that a mode retaking the panel gives its current card a full turn.

The dwell clock (last_game_switch) keeps running while a mode is off
screen, so on re-entry it was always long expired and the first display()
call advanced immediately: the card cut off by the end of the previous
block was skipped instead of shown -- measured live at one in five card
transitions on a 30s block of 15s cards -- and after a service restart the
clock started at manager construction, seconds before the first frame,
producing a 9s card and a 5s card in the first block. _reset_dwell_on_
reentry treats any multi-second gap between display() calls as a block
boundary and restarts the dwell clock for the current card.

These checks pin:

  * the very first display() call after startup resets the clock;
  * calls inside one on-screen stint (sub-second apart) do not;
  * a call after a long away gap does;
  * the live screen's last_game_switch == 0 sentinel is left alone.

Exercised against a stand-in ``self``, same as the other timing tests:
no display hardware, no network.
