"""The colour pickers the schema offers have to actually colour something.

customization.score_text.text_color and its five siblings have been in the
schema, with a colour-picker widget, since the fonts they sit beside were
added. Setting one changed which face was loaded and nothing else: both
renderers drew every string white. The scroll/Vegas card honoured them at
four draws -- the newer upcoming-centre ones, which named their element by
hand -- and at none of the other seven.

The colour now follows the face. The font loader already picks each face from
exactly the element whose colour applies to it (element_key=), so resolving
the fill from the face in _draw_text_with_outline covers every draw at once
and cannot drift out of step with them.

What this pins down:

  * every default is white, so a config nobody has touched renders exactly
    what it rendered before -- checked as pixels, against a reference drawn
    the old way rather than against the new helper.
  * a configured colour reaches the text drawn in that element's face, in
    both the full-screen scorebug and the card.
  * an explicit fill still wins. The odds colours and the favourite-result
    score tint mean something the palette does not.
  * a face shared between elements resolves to white rather than guessing.
