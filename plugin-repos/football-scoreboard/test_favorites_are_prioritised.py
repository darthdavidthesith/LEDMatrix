"""Favourites must appear even when "show favorite teams only" is off.

Reported as: "I want to see my favorites and other teams, not ONLY my
favorites, which is why it was off. Shouldn't we still prioritize favorites in
upcoming and recent even if 'show favorites only' is off?"

They should, and they did not. The flag was the whole story: on, and you saw
nothing but your teams; off, and your teams were ignored *entirely* -- the
selection took the next N games league-wide. On a real board that is 946
upcoming college games in the window, so a UGA fan saw UGA about as often as
chance allowed. There was no way to ask for "my teams, plus some others",
which is what almost everyone actually wants.

`_favorites_first` is that middle setting. Both limits are TOTALS here rather
than per-team budgets: in favourites-only mode `upcoming_games_to_show` is per
team, which is fine when the list is your own handful of teams, but AP_TOP_10
resolves to a dozen and three games each is 28 cards before a single other game
is added.
