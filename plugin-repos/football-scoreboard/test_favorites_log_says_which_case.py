"""The "no favorites" log must not fire when favorites ARE configured.

Reported as "why am I not seeing the upcoming NCAA games when I have NCAA
Football Upcoming set to 3 games?". The limit was working: the board was
showing 3 upcoming games. They were the next 3 in all of college football
rather than the user's teams, because show_favorite_teams_only was off --
having favourites is not enough, the only-flag has to be on too.

What made that hard to see was the log. In sequence, from a real board:

    Favorite teams: ['UGA', 'AU']
    Found 12 favorite team upcoming games
    No favorites configured: showing 3 total upcoming games

Twelve favourite games found, then told there are no favourites. The branch
means "not favourites-ONLY", and it now says so, naming the teams and the
setting to change.

Since then that branch also stopped ignoring favourites altogether -- it shows
them first and tops up with other games -- so the message reports the split and
points at other_upcoming_games_to_show. See test_favorites_are_prioritised.py
for the selection itself; this file only guards the wording.

This drives SportsUpcoming.update() and reads what it logged, rather than
inspecting the source: the wording is the whole point of the change, so the
test has to observe the wording that actually reaches a user's journal.
