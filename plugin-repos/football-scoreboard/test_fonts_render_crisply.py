"""Default fonts must land on their face's pixel grid.

PressStart2P and 4x6-font are pixel-art faces: they rasterise cleanly only at
whole multiples of their grid (8 and 7 respectively). At any other size
FreeType anti-aliases to fake the in-between stroke widths.

On an LED matrix that is not a soft edge -- every pixel is a physical lamp, so
a half-lit edge pixel is a dim lamp, and the text reads as smeared. It showed
up worst on 64-tall panels, where _detail_font_size scaled the odds to 10px:
65% of the lit pixels were partial, and the over/under and spread came out
visibly broken.

The defaults were off-grid almost everywhere -- score 10, status 6, rank 10 --
so this was never specific to the odds; they were just the most obvious.

One deliberate exception: on a 32-tall panel the detail font stays at 6px,
off-grid. The next crisp size is 7px, and at 7px the over/under no longer fits
beside the centre text -- the collision guard drops it entirely. A missing
number is worse than a fuzzy one, so 32-tall keeps its softness.
