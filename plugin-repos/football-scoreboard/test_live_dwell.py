"""Tests that a live game's dwell does not depend on the data refresh rate.

The rotation used to live in update(), which runs on live_update_interval --
30s by default. A game could therefore only be advanced at that cadence, so
every configured duration was quantised to it. Measured on a live rig with
four NFL games: live_game_duration=45 and non_favorite_live_game_duration=10
both produced a flat 30s rotation, and only changing live_update_interval
changed anything. Setting a short non-favorite dwell did nothing at all.

It is driven from display() now, so the dwell is what was configured and the
refresh rate is just the refresh rate.

Run: <core-venv>/bin/python plugins/football-scoreboard/test_live_dwell.py
