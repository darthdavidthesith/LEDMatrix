"""Tests that the live screen can be driven offline, and draws a real scorebug.

Regression under test: live was the one screen the safety harness never
rendered. Its own fixture said why -- "NFLLiveManager._fetch_data() ->
_fetch_todays_games() is a direct network call with no cache read and no
test_mode passthrough in _adapt_config_for_manager, so the live screen can
never be fed from mock data" -- so live mode was switched off there.

Two things made it untestable, and both were latent bugs rather than gaps:

  * `_adapt_config_for_manager()` never passed `test_mode` into the per-manager
    config, so `SportsLive.test_mode` could not be set from config at all. The
    fully-seeded simulated game in `NFLLiveManager.__init__` was unreachable.
  * `SportsLive.update()` fetched unconditionally, so even with the flag set
    the seeded game was overwritten on the first tick. `_test_mode_update()`
    was defined and never called -- dead code. baseball-scoreboard had already
    fixed the same thing; this ports it.

Which matters now because the season starts in weeks and live is the screen
that carries it. Bugs in this path stay dormant all off-season, exactly as the
has_live_content log flood did (see test_live_content_log_throttle.py:
"football was dormant only because it was the off-season").
