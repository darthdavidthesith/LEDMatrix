"""The score must not swamp a narrow panel.

sports.py loaded the score at PressStart2P 10px on every panel. That face is
fixed-width and wide: "17-21" comes out 50px. On a 128-wide panel that is 39%
of the width and fine -- it is what both of the maintained rigs run. On a
64-wide panel it is 78%, and the score, the clock and two logos were all
contending for the same strip, so the logos were reduced to slivers behind
the digits.

PressStart2P has no smaller crisp size -- its pixel grid is 8, and 10 was
already off-grid and anti-aliased. So the way down is a narrower FACE, not a
smaller size: 4x6-font is crisp at multiples of 7 and about half as wide,
putting the same score at 24px / 38%.

The swap is conditional on the score actually overflowing, so it must not
touch any panel where the old face already fitted -- in particular the 128x32
and 512x64 builds, which must render byte-identically.
