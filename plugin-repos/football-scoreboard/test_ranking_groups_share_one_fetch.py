"""AP_TOP_5, AP_TOP_10 and AP_TOP_25 are one ranking list, not three.

All three patterns resolve from the same poll and differ only in how far down
it they slice. The cache was keyed by PATTERN, though, while the value stored
was the whole list -- so configuring two of them fetched the identical payload
twice, stored it twice, and expired it twice, for no difference in the result.

Seen on a real board: dynamic_teams_ncaa_fb_AP_TOP_10.json and
dynamic_teams_ncaa_fb_AP_TOP_25.json sat side by side in the cache, both
holding the same 25 teams.

Keyed by sport instead, so the poll is fetched once and every group slices the
same cached list.
