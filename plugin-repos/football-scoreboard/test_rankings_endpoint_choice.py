"""College rankings must come from the endpoint that actually has them.

`fetch_standings` used to try /standings first and fall back to /rankings only
on a 404. College football answers /standings with **HTTP 200** and no
"rankings" key, so the fallback never fired and the poll was never fetched.

Nothing failed. `_fetch_team_rankings` just parsed a body with no rankings in
it, cached an empty table, and every consumer quietly did nothing: the AP rank
badge never appeared however `show_ranking` was set, and the "ranked" quality
filter passed every game because an empty table fails open.

Verified against the live API on 2026-08-27:

    football/college-football/standings -> 200, no "rankings" key
    football/college-football/rankings  -> 200, 3 ranking blocks
    football/nfl/standings              -> 200
    football/nfl/rankings               -> 404

So the endpoint has to be chosen by league, not discovered by error code.
