"""
Tests that SportsRecent.update() fetches odds for the finals it selects.

SportsUpcoming fetches odds for the games that survive selection, and
SportsLive fetches them per included game -- SportsRecent never fetched
them at all. A recent card only showed a line when the other-games
rotation happened to swap it in (which fetches odds for the fresh slice),
and a league whose recent pool fits inside its limits never rotates: its
finals stayed bare while a busier league's rotated cards drew theirs.
Observed live: NFL's eight recents rotated and showed lines, NCAA's lone
final never did, with both leagues' show_odds on. ESPN keeps a completed
game's closing line on the same endpoint, so a final is as answerable as
an upcoming game.

These checks pin:

  * update() asks for odds for exactly the finals it selected;
  * show_odds off means no requests;
  * non-final games in the feed are not asked about.

Exercised against a probe subclass with the data hooks stubbed, same as
test_favorites_are_prioritised.py: no display hardware, no network --
_fetch_odds itself is a recorder.
