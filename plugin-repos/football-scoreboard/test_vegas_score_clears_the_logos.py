"""The score must never be drawn on top of a logo on a scroll/Vegas card.

Reported against the Vegas ticker and reproduced on devpi's 512x64 panel:
"34-13" rendered ~80px wide inside a 36px centre gap, so roughly 17px of the
score sat on each team's logo.

The cause was that the two numbers were computed from unrelated inputs. The
gap came from the CARD WIDTH (width x CENTER_GAP_RATIO, clamped to 40px) while
the score's size came from config and the element-style resolver. Nothing
compared them, so any font large enough to outgrow 40px silently overlapped --
and every harness render still passed, because the harness exercises the
regular display, not the scroll cards.

Two changes, both needed:
  - the gap is now measured from the score actually loaded, so it cannot be
    narrower than the text it has to hold;
  - the card is sized "two full-height logos plus that gap", so widening the
    gap does not pay for itself by shrinking the logos -- which is the
    "logos aren't visible" failure we already rejected once.

The checks below are written against the FONT-SIZE-AGNOSTIC property: whatever
size the score ends up, it fits the gap and the logos get the rest. That is
what makes this robust to a config or resolver that picks a different size
from the one this checkout happens to load.
