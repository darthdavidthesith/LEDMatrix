"""
Tests that map tiles are never fetched over the network on the render thread.

Regression under test: _fetch_tile() went to the network on a cache miss, and
the render path reaches it through get_vegas_content(). A tile normally
arrives in tens of milliseconds; an unreachable one costs the full timeout,
and on the render thread that is a frozen marquee. Measured on a live rig at
3458ms, 3377ms and 3479ms in a single session -- the existing 3s timeout and
300s cooldown bounded that to one freeze per five minutes rather than
removing it, which the module comment says outright.

The render path now serves the cache only and records what it went without;
update() fetches those on the plugin manager's update worker, where a timeout
costs nothing visible.
