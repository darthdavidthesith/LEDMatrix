"""The map must be composed at the width the ticker asked for.

Vegas asks a plugin for a narrower render so a layout built for the full panel
does not read as sparse in the ticker. It normally delivers that by narrowing
the shared canvas for the duration of the call, which a plugin sizing itself
from ``matrix.width`` picks up for free. But it cannot narrow the canvas in
offscreen mode -- ``_render_at`` swaps the shared canvas, which is unsafe
there -- so it only sets ``_vegas_render_width`` and notes that a plugin
reading ``get_vegas_render_width()`` still gets the narrow size while one that
only reads ``matrix.width`` "renders full width and is trimmed instead".

This plugin relied on the canvas being narrowed. Its own docstring said the
projection scales "without any extra plumbing". On a live rig that assumption
held three times out of twelve:

    [ledmatrix-flights] Native: requesting 256px instead of 512px
    [ledmatrix-flights] Native: SUCCESS - 1 images, 512px total width
    [ledmatrix-flights] Native: SUCCESS - 1 images, 256px total width

so the same map came back at two different widths depending on which path the
adapter took, and the full-width renders were cropped afterwards.

No plugin in the repo read get_vegas_render_width() before this.
