"""Working around two ESPN site-API behaviours that silently break scoreboards.

Both were found on 2026-09-15, when every scoreboard on the Pi started logging
``400 Client Error: Bad Request`` against URLs that had worked the day before.

1. **Date ranges are rejected.** ``?dates=YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD`` answers
   ``400 {"code":400,"message":"Failed to get events endpoint."}`` for *every*
   sport -- football, baseball, hockey, basketball, soccer alike. Single days
   (``?dates=YYYYMMDD``), whole months (``?dates=YYYYMM``) and season years
   (``?dates=YYYY``) still answer 200.

2. **``limit`` above 500 corrupts the response.** ``limit=1000`` -- what every
   caller in this codebase used to send -- makes college-football return 25
   events where the truthful answer is 68 for a single Saturday and 323 for a
   month. No error, just a short list. The cutoff sits between 500 and 600.
   NFL-sized days never noticed, which is why this hid for so long.

The fix for (1) is to re-ask in units ESPN still honours. Whole calendar months
covered by the range become one ``YYYYMM`` request each and the leftover days at
either end become one ``YYYYMMDD`` request each, so the chunks cover the
requested window *exactly* -- no client-side date filtering, and therefore no
guessing at which timezone ESPN means by "a game day". A full NFL season
(20260801-20270301) costs 8 requests rather than 213 per-day ones.

A month can hold more than 500 events (college baseball's March does), and
ESPN answers that with exactly ``limit`` events and no hint that more exist. A
month chunk that comes back full is therefore re-asked day by day.

Once a range has been rejected, later ranges skip straight to chunks for
``RANGE_RETRY_SECONDS`` instead of spending a doomed request first -- live
scoreboards ask every 30 seconds. After that the range is tried again, so the
workaround retires itself if ESPN reverts.
