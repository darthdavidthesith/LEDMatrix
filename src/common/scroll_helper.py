        the same number of WHOLE pixels every frame, and deriving that from a
        wall clock cannot deliver it: the position accumulates
        ``speed * delta_time`` and is then truncated to a pixel, so any jitter

        It is worst precisely at a crisp speed. At 100 px/s on a 100Hz panel

        jitter flips it either way and the motion beats at around 50Hz.

        the panel has taken the frame, which makes the frame count a truer
